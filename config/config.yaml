# --- HMMER Parameters ---
e_value_cutoff: 0.001 # E-value threshold for hmmsearch hits

# --- Negative Set Generation Strategy ---
# Choose between 'random_swissprot' or 'structurally_similar'
# Set to 'structurally_similar' for a more challenging validation
negative_set_strategy: 'structurally_similar' 

# Parameters for 'random_swissprot' strategy (if used)
num_negative_samples: 50000 

# Parameters for 'structurally_similar' strategy (if negative_set_strategy is set to this)
# IMPORTANT: These are *example* PDB IDs for demonstration. In a real project,
# you would meticulously curate these to be genuinely structurally similar
# but functionally unrelated to Kunitz, and NOT Kunitz themselves.
# These examples are small, disulfide-rich peptides/proteins, which might be
# structurally similar to Kunitz in a very general sense.

  - "1AON" # Cyclotide (plant defense peptide)

# --- Clustering Parameters ---
# These parameters are used by data_prep.py for redundancy reduction (CD-HIT).
# Lowering the identity threshold makes the sets more diverse (less redundant).
clustering_identity_threshold: 0.70 # More stringent clustering (e.g., 70% identity)
clustering_length_difference_cutoff: 0.90 # Length difference cutoff (e.g., 90% length overlap)
